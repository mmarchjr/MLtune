# FRC Shooter Bayesian Tuner - Requirements

# Core dependencies (these you definitely need)
scikit-optimize>=0.9.0
numpy>=1.21.0
pandas>=1.3.0
# Note: keyboard library may require root/admin privileges on Linux/Mac/Chromebook
# If hotkey registration fails, the tuner will fall back to Ctrl+C
keyboard>=0.13.5

# NetworkTables - use ONE of these options:
# Option 1: pyntcore (recommended - modern WPILib)
pyntcore>=2024.0.0
# Option 2: pynetworktables (older, but still works)
# pynetworktables>=2021.0.0

# ---------------------------------------------------------
# Optional dependencies for enhanced functionality
#
# Looking for something extra? These aren't required,
# but might help with bonus features—or hint at what
# could land in future updates.
