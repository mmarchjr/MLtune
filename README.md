## Note
This has not finished having all of its code and documentation transferred over from the previous one. 
It may take a week or so due to the nessescary actions of updating, documenting, organizing, troubleshooting, bug fixing, and rebranding.
I will attemlt to get it finished at my earliest conviencence. 

thank you for your patience.
